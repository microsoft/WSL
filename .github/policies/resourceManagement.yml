            Hello! Could you please provide more logs to help us better diagnose your issue? 


            To collect WSL logs, download and execute [collect-wsl-logs.ps1](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/blob/master/diagnostics/collect-wsl-logs.ps1) in an **administrative powershell prompt**:


            ```

            Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/WSL/master/diagnostics/collect-wsl-logs.ps1" -OutFile collect-wsl-logs.ps1

            Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

            .\collect-wsl-logs.ps1

            ```

            The scipt will output the path of the log file once done. 


            Once completed please upload the output files to this Github issue.
